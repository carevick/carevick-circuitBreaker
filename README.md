# circuit_breakers

## Household circuit breaker panel

### Description
This project is a personal idea and was made for easier insight into the arrangement of circuit breakers inside household electrical system (panel).

It is digital substitute for writed labels physical attached to each separately ciruit breaker.

Now we can **quickly access** information about the purpose of the ciruit breaker and easily find which breaker to turn off if necessary, especially in **emergency situations**. 

It *simplifies life*, no more guessing which fuse is for which purpose. The retro image reminds us of ephemeral nature of life.

Features that I hope to implement in the future would shorten the code and bring the project to completion faster.
